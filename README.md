# WifiPhisher
WiFiPhisher is a tool to attack Wi-Fi networks using social engineering methods, without the need to brute-force passwords. This tool works by creating an Evil Twin Attack, which creates a fake Wi-Fi network that imitates the real network and tricks users into entering their credentials.
